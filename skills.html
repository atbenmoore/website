			<h2 class="STitle">Consultant</h2>
			<p>I have been an IT consultant for over a year now, dealing with (you need to put what you've dealt with... I don't understand it haha)
I love to connect with clients and work in a team to understand the business process requirements, and recommend the best solution for them. This entails working alongside the project team, to undertake a detailed analysis of the business and to then turn this into a plan, which incorporates all of the business stakeholders' points of view.</p>

			<h2 class="STitle">Testing</h2>
			<p> I have experience working alongside the developers to test releases and ensure that these are to an acceptable standard before releasing them to the customer. This may include collaborating with the relevant developer to resolve anything that comes out of the testing. I am currently studying towards completing my BCS Qualification in Software Testing, at both a Foundation and an Intermediate level.

			<h2 class="STitle">Support</h2>
			<p>I have experience of working within a support team, being the first point of contact for the customer. This time has allowed me to gain a strong customer focus, and understand how to best keep customer satisfaction at a high level. Keeping customers informed of the status of their issue, alongside recommendations on how to prevent the problem from occurring again (this sentence doesn't make sense?!). I have experience of carrying out detailed tests to understand the cause of the problem and how to solve it so that the same issue doesnâ€™t arise again. </p>

      <img class="logo" src="img/coding.png" alt="Coding Skill">
			<h2 class="STitle">Coding</h2>
			<p>I have learnt how to code on my own, with a little help from Treehouse (check out my profile <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/atbenmoore"> here</a>). Throughout this self-learning experience I have learnt how to use HTML, CSS and Javascript, building projects with the knowledge I have gained from these practices. It has also improved my ability to be very logical when approaching any issue within my code. </p>

      <img class="logo" src="img/projects.png" alt="Project Skill">
			<h2 class="STitle">Projects</h2>
			<p>I have worked on numerous projects, working within the project team to keep detailed documentation, including project plans and reports from start to finish. Working with the customer to ensure that that the project stays on track and keeps to the scope of the project, through until completion </p>
